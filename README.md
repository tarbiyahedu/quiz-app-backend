## üöÄ Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root (not committed to git). Here are the required variables:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
API_URL=http://localhost:5000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

> **On Vercel:**
> - Go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables.
> - Add each variable above with your actual values.
> - Redeploy after saving.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Missing config.js**: This project does not require a `config.js` file. All configuration is handled via environment variables.
- **Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'MONGODB_URI')**: Ensure you have set `MONGO_URL` in your environment variables (locally in `.env`, and in Vercel dashboard for deployment).
- **.env not uploaded to Vercel**: Vercel does not upload your local `.env` file. You must manually add variables in the dashboard.
